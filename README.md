# Clothing-Recommendation
### BA 820 Unsupervised Machine Learning

Business Problem:
In recent years, with emphasis during the pandemic, e-commerce has increased dramatically. During the lockdown, consumers who wanted to go shopping were forced to do it online in most countries. It is difficult for users to not only find something they like on online platforms but also to find the correct sizing and fit. Itâ€™s more likely that they will order the wrong size and have to return the item. Therefore, the company would have to handle returns, which will increase costs and decrease revenue. Moreover, as more people get vaccinated and more places remove their quarantine policies, the demand for attending social events is increasing dramatically. 

Through the project, we hope to analyze the different attributes of a person and associate them to a particular item and size in order to subsequently give the consumers recommendations on size that are potentially more accurate than the consumer attempting to make an educated guess. In order to also help consumers find items that they might also like, we want to build a recommendation system that recommends clothing items according to interests and items they are already interested in. We believe our recommendation can assist users to better find what they need and thus make them order more, which will generate higher revenue.
